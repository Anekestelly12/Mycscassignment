<br> I really want to thank God for what he has done in my life because without him i will not have been able to achieve<br>
<br> anything in my academics <br>
<p> firstly i completed my first leaving school certificate i really appreciate him for making me to come out with good <br>
<br> grades and for not making bad things to happen to me then i entered secondary school and graduated with flying colours<br>
<p> Aterwards i proceeded to run a program called JUPEB (joint unitary preliminary examination board) when i arrived the<br>
<br> students there told me the examination was very hard so i had to read very well and prepared very well for the <br>
<br> examination and by the time the mock examination result came out i did very well and i knew for  sure i would do very<br>
<br> in the final examination and i did so i give all the glory to the almighty God</br>
